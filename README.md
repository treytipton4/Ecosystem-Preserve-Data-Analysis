# Ecosystem-Preserve-Data-Analysis

As a group of four students, we were asked to do statistical consultancy for a partner in the community. We were assigned to wrangle messy data, create exploratory graphics, and fit a model for the Calvin University Ecosystem Preserve. The data was collected from the 100 acre nature preserve at Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Twelve baskets were placed randomly around the area to collect fallen leaves and the baskets were then weighed once at the time of collection and again two weeks later in order to let water weight from rain evaporate. The data also includes numerous variables about the weather and the dates that they were collected.

A map of the Ecosystem preserve and the locations of the baskets can be seen [here]('Eco Preserve Map.jpg').

Our goal was to determine what factors affect the leaves drop and to see how leaves drop over time, not only over the course of the fall season, but also over several years.

An HTML of the full project, including wrangling, can be seen at the link below.
